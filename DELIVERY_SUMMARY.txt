# FINAL DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS

This package contains the complete, updated source code for the HK-Checklist application. 

### 📁 Files included in this folder:
1. **Source Code**: All application files (app, resources, routes, etc.)
2. **CHANGES.pdf / .txt**: Detailed log of all bugs fixed and features added.
3. **start-server.bat**: One-click script to run the project locally.
4. **README_FOR_CLIENT.md**: Detailed technical guide for server deployment.

---

### 🛠 Steps for YOU (before sending to client):
1. **The Zip File**: I have created/updated the `HK-Checklist-Clean-Version.zip`. This is the file you should send to your client.
2. **Database SQL**: If the client requires a MySQL database dump, they should run the migrations on their server as per the `README_FOR_CLIENT.md`. The system will automatically build the structure.

---

### 🚀 Steps for the CLIENT (Deployment):
1. **Upload**: Upload the contents of the ZIP to their server (cPanel or VPS).
2. **Environment (.env)**: 
   - Rename `.env.example` to `.env`.
   - Update database credentials (`DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`).
   - Set `APP_URL` to their domain.
3. **Run Commands**:
   - `composer install --no-dev`
   - `php artisan key:generate`
   - `php artisan migrate` (Run this to update the table structure. Do NOT run with `--seed` if you already have data).
4. **Storage Link**: Run `php artisan storage:link` (or use the included `fix-storage-symlink.bat`) to ensure photos display correctly.

### 🔑 Database Note:
As per your request, I have removed all "Demo" logins and sample data from the automated setup. The system will now respect your existing Users, Properties, and Tasks.

**Status**: Project is fully tested, bugs are resolved, and the iCal sync is fully functional.
